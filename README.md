# Glitch-the-STD-IN-OUT :stars:
I have made three python programs that will cat like glitches if run on any PC, Don't Merge them all beacuse then they are more harder to control, I made them in a way that they are fun to prank your friends. <br> Console will not pop up if you remove the installation commands, Making them unnoticable when they start. <br> You can put them in PC startup folder.
